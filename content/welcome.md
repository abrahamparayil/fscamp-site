If you are new to these terms, here is an explanation:

## Mailing list:

A mail send to a mailing list is distributed to all members, so when we send an email to camp-announce mailing list, all of you will get a copy of the mail.

We have sent you an invitation to join the camp-announce mailing list, but Gmail seems to be marking it as spam even though we have correct DKIM and SPF records (these are standards for authenticating emails) for our emails. If you mark the invitation as not spam, it may help new people receive the mail in their inbox.

## Mastodon/Fediverse:

Mastodon is a Free Software to create a social media service similar to Twitter in features. Unlike twitter, mastodon is not controlled by a single company. Many people and organizations around the world run their own mastodon services which are referred to as instances and users of any of these instances can interact with users of any other instance. Additionally there are other software interoperable with mastodon and all of it together constitute the fediverse. Some other software part of the Fediverse are Pleroma, Friendica, Peertube, Pixelfed etc.

## Matrix/Element:

Matrix is a communication protocol for sharing instant messages, photos, files and audio/video calls. Element is most feature-complete app for Matrix protocol and is available on smart phones and laptop/desktop. Matrix has a similar decentralized architecture to mastodon, where different people and organizations provide an interoperable network of home servers (similar to an instance of mastodon). If you are new to using matrix, you can sign up for accounts by following instructions at [https://chat.feneas.org](https://chat.feneas.org), [https://chat.tchncs.de](https://chat.tchncs.de) or [https://chat.privacytools.io](https://chat.privacytools.io), instead of using matrix.org which will help to reduce their server load.

You can reach out to us by mailing to [camp@mm.gnu.org.in](mailto:camp@mm.gnu.org.in) for any queries or concerns.

Regards,  

Free Software Camp Organizing Team
